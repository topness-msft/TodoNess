# TodoNess - Project Notes

## Overview
TodoNess is a local AI-powered task manager that integrates with Microsoft 365 via WorkIQ MCP. It reads M365 context (flagged emails, meetings, calendar) to surface actionable suggestions, lets users manage tasks through a web dashboard, and provides AI coaching on each task.

## Technology Stack
- **Runtime:** Python 3.11
- **Web Framework:** Tornado 6.4+
- **Templating:** Jinja2 3.1+
- **Database:** SQLite3 (WAL mode)
- **Dependencies:** `tornado`, `jinja2` (see `requirements.txt`)

## Architecture
```
Claude Code Commands (/todo-refresh, /todo-add, /todo-parse, skills)
  ↕ calls WorkIQ MCP    ↕ writes SQLite
SQLite DB (data/claudetodo.db)
  tasks | task_context | refresh_schedule | sync_log
Tornado Web Server (localhost:8766)
  Reads SQLite → serves dashboard + REST API + WebSocket
```

WorkIQ queries happen inside Claude Code commands only. The Tornado server never calls WorkIQ directly.

## Email Integration Policy

**Email is context for existing tasks, never a source of new task suggestions.**

### Why email scanning is disabled for task creation
WorkIQ enterprise search cannot reliably scope email queries to the Inbox folder. Queries return items from Archive, Deleted Items, and other folders indiscriminately. It also cannot detect flagged status or filter by folder location. This makes email a noisy, unreliable source for surfacing new tasks — too many false positives from old or discarded messages.

### Where email IS used
Email serves as **read-only context** to enrich tasks that already exist:
- `/waiting-check` — cross-channel queries include email to detect if a key person replied via email even when the task originated from Teams or meetings
- `/todo-review` — coaching context refresh includes email to build a fuller picture of task history and communication

### Why person-scoped email queries work
These queries succeed where broad scanning fails because they ask a narrower question: "did [specific person] email about [known topic] in [recent window]?" They don't need folder awareness or flag detection. Even archived replies are valid signal — a response is a response regardless of where Outlook filed it.

### Re-evaluation
Re-evaluate this policy when Graph MCP or improved WorkIQ email folder/flag access becomes available.

## Key Files
- `src/db.py` — SQLite schema, connection management
- `src/models.py` — Task CRUD, lifecycle (promote/dismiss/complete/start), context, sync log
- `src/app.py` — Tornado routes, entry point (port 8766), `start_server()` for embedded use
- `src/handlers/task_api.py` — REST API: /api/tasks, /api/tasks/<id>, /api/stats
- `src/handlers/task_actions.py` — POST /api/tasks/<id>/action
- `src/handlers/ws.py` — WebSocket at /ws for live updates
- `src/handlers/dashboard.py` — GET / renders dashboard
- `src/services/workiq_queries.py` — M365 query templates (Teams/meetings scan + awaiting-response)
- `src/services/claude_runner.py` — Shared `copilot -p` subprocess manager (label-based dedup)
- `src/services/refresh_scheduler.py` — Adaptive refresh intervals
- `scripts/todoness_tray.pyw` — System tray launcher (runs server in background thread)
- `scripts/install_startup.py` — Register TodoNess as a Windows logon startup task
- `scripts/uninstall_startup.py` — Remove startup task and stop running tray process

## Commands
| Command | Purpose | Uses WorkIQ? |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `/todo` | Status summary + dashboard URL | No |
| `/todo-add "text"` | Add task via NL, Claude parses + WorkIQ resolves | Yes |
| `/todo-parse` | Parse unparsed tasks from dashboard | Yes |
| `/todo-refresh` | Full M365 scan: Teams/meetings + awaiting-response → suggested tasks | Yes |
| `/todo-review` | Interactive review of tasks needing attention | Yes |
| `/waiting-check` | Check for activity on waiting tasks | Yes |
| `/suggestion-check` | Check if suggested tasks are already resolved | Yes |

## Skills
- `respond-email` — Draft email response for email-sourced tasks
- `schedule-meeting` — Suggest meeting times based on calendar availability
- `teams-message` — Draft a Teams message for chat-based tasks
- `follow-up` — Draft a follow-up message for tasks needing a check-in
- `prepare` — Build preparation notes for meetings/presentations
- `suggestion-check` — Check suggested tasks for resolution status (runs every 3 hr)

## Database Schema
Four tables: `tasks`, `task_context`, `refresh_schedule`, `sync_log`. See `src/db.py` for full schema.

## Task Status Flow
- **suggested** → active, waiting, snoozed, dismissed, deleted
- **active** → in_progress, waiting, snoozed, completed, dismissed, deleted
- **in_progress** → active, waiting, snoozed, completed, deleted
- **waiting** → active, in_progress, snoozed, completed, deleted
- **snoozed** → active, completed, dismissed, deleted
- **completed** → active, deleted
- **dismissed** → active, suggested, deleted

## Parse Status Flow (dashboard input)
unparsed → queued → parsing → parsed

## Sync Flow (/todo-refresh)
1. Check sync_log for last sync time → determine scan window (1-7 days)
2. WorkIQ scans (separate calls): (a) Teams messages + meeting action items, (b) awaiting-response items
3. 3-tier priority validation: Direct (keep priority) → Group (downgrade by 1) → Tangential (P5)
4. Two-pass dedup: exact match on source_id, then semantic match by sender
5. Augment existing tasks with new context (dismissed items are never re-suggested)
6. Parse any unparsed tasks (same as /todo-parse)
7. Log to sync_log with result summary JSON

## Running

### Console mode
```bash
# Start the TodoNess dashboard (foreground, logs to stderr)
python -m src.app 8766
# Open http://localhost:8766
```

### System tray mode (Windows)
```bash
# Launch via pythonw (no console window, logs to data/todoness.log)
pythonw scripts/todoness_tray.pyw
```
The tray icon provides "Open Dashboard", "Sync Now", and "Stop & Exit" menu items.
Single-instance guard via `data/todoness.pid`.

### Start at Windows logon
```bash
# Install as a Windows Task Scheduler task (runs at logon)
python scripts/install_startup.py

# Remove startup task and stop running instance
python scripts/uninstall_startup.py
```
The installer registers a scheduled task named "TodoNess" that runs `pythonw scripts/todoness_tray.pyw` at logon. It also installs `pystray` and `Pillow` if missing.
